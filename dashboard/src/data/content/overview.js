## Conclusion

**This codebase is NOT production-ready.** While it has some good architectural foundations (Expo Router, Context API, basic component structure), it suffers from critical issues that make it unsuitable for production deployment, especially for a healthcare application where reliability and security are paramount.


**Key Strengths:**
- Good folder structure
- Expo Router implementation
- Context API usage
- Basic component library exists

**Critical Weaknesses:**
- No security (exposed keys)
- No error handling
- Extensive hardcoding
- No design system
- Poor code quality
- Git merge conflicts
- Chaotic styling approach

**Recommendation:** Significant refactoring required before production deployment.
